        <h1>IZI Games — Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="muted"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> September 04, 2025</p>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>IZI Games</strong> — a collection of mini puzzle games. We care about your privacy. This
            policy explains what information we (and third parties used by the app) may collect and how it is used.</p>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Scope</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the IZI Games mobile application (the “App”). It does not cover external
            stores or websites (for example Google Play) used to download the App or separate services you may contact.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. What we do NOT collect directly</h2>
        <p>IZI Games is designed to run primarily on your device. We do <strong>not</strong> collect or store personal
            information on our servers. Specifically, we do not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>collect or store personal data on our servers;</li>
            <li>access your contacts, photos, camera, microphone, or GPS;</li>
            <li>collect precise location or personal identifiers such as IMEI on our own.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. On-device statistics (kept locally)</h2>
        <p>The App displays simple usage statistics (for example: levels completed, scores, play time, achievements).
            Those statistics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>are generated and stored <strong>only on your device</strong>;</li>
            <li>are not uploaded to our servers or shared with us automatically;</li>
            <li>can usually be reset by reinstalling the app or using any in-app reset option (if provided).</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
            <strong>Note:</strong> If you manually share screenshots, exported files, or email logs to us for support,
            that information is provided by you and will be handled only for support purposes.
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Advertising & Third Parties</h2>
        <p>IZI Games displays ads served by third-party advertising networks (for example, Google AdMob or similar ad
            providers). These third-party providers <strong>may</strong> collect certain information automatically in
            order to deliver ads. Such data may include, but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Advertising ID (a resettable device identifier);</li>
            <li>Basic device information (model, OS version, language, app usage context);</li>
            <li>Approximate location derived from IP address (used to show relevant ads).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not control how third-party ad networks process collected information — their behavior is governed by
            their own privacy policies. To learn more or to opt out of ad personalization, please check your device
            advertising settings (for example, Android's Ads settings) and the privacy pages of the ad providers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Children’s privacy</h2>
        <p>IZI Games is suitable for a general audience and may be used by children. However, because the App contains
            ads, third-party networks may collect limited information to serve age-appropriate advertising. We do not
            knowingly collect personal information directly from children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age in
            your country). If you believe a child has provided personal information to us (for example by emailing us),
            please contact us so we can promptly delete it.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Your rights & choices</h2>
        <p>Depending on where you live, you may have rights related to data processing (for example: the right to
            opt-out of targeted advertising). Because we do not collect personal data on our servers, we cannot access
            or delete information held by third-party ad networks — you must contact those networks directly or use the
            controls on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Turn off ad personalization or reset your advertising ID in device settings;</li>
            <li>Review and manage permissions for other apps that may share device data;</li>
            <li>Contact ad providers to exercise rights regarding their processing of data.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>7. Security</h2>
        <p>Local app data (game progress and statistics) remains on your device. We do not transmit that data to our
            servers. Ads are delivered over secure connections by third-party providers. To protect your local data,
            keep your device secure (device passcode, up-to-date OS, and safe backups).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>8. Data retention</h2>
        <p>We do not retain personal data on our servers. The ad providers we use may retain data per their policies —
            consult the privacy policy of each ad provider for details about retention periods.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>9. International users</h2>
        <p>Ads and related processing by third-party providers may occur in multiple countries. Please refer to the
            privacy policies of the ad networks used by the App for details on cross-border data transfers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>10. Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to the App, legal requirements, or ad integrations. If
            we make material changes, we will update the effective date above and, if required, provide notice in the
            App.</p>
    </section>
