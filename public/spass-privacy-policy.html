        <h1>Privacy Policy for Safe Password Manager</h1>
        <p class="muted"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 31, 2025</p>
        <p>Safe Password Manager ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy
            explains how we handle your data while using our offline password manager mobile application.</p>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>1. No Internet Connection & No Data Collection</h2>
        <p>We take your privacy seriously. Our app works primarily offline and does not connect to the internet for
            password storage. However, internet access may be used for ads and Google Play services (billing, license
            verification).</p>
        <p>We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal information or user data on our servers. All data you
            enter is securely stored locally on your device only.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Local Data Storage & Encryption</h2>
        <p>Your passwords and any sensitive data stored in the app are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stored only on your device</li>
            <li>Encrypted using strong encryption algorithms</li>
            <li>Accessible only through your master password, which we do not store or transmit</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Losing your master password may mean losing access to your data — we have no way to recover it.</p>
    </section>
